# Sim-City--ish

This game is a very bare-bones version of SimCity.
You have a board of 100x100 to build the following 1x1 structures: 
1. Road: Just a visual asset to keep everything looking good.
2. House: Where your population will live.
3. Farm: Produces food. If there's not enough food, people will leave.
4. Factory: Produces jobs.

When you click "End Turn", the game will process the number of structures you've built and update population, food, jobs and cash information.
